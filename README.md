# Outlier-detection
Outliers have always been present in all kinds of data, a fact that has been a concern of statisticians for decades. This led to a series of attempts to define outliers as well as an interdisciplinary, almost unmanageable flood of mathematical methods to identify outliers and deal with them in an appropriated way. Many of these methods were developed for highly specific situations, which is why there is still no accepted uniform approach to outliers in the scientific community. Nevertheless, typical and commonly used groups of methods and definitions can be identified. The interdisciplinary aspect of outlier detection has led to an increased use of modern methods of data mining in addition to classical statistical methods. Since different statistical methods in general often only work under very specific assumptions, the main aim of this term paper is to determine the performance of the data mining techniques versus the classical statistical methods within different scenarios through a simulation study.

Three statistical methods, namely the Z-Score method, IQR method and the generalized ESD method, as well as  three data mining methods, particularly k-Nearest neighbor, k-Medoids and Kohonens' Self-Organizing maps,  which belong to the field of data mining methods are proposed and compared to each other by using a simulation study.
